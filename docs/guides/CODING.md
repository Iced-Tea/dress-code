# Coding Conventions and Guidelines

## Coding conventions:

* We use the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) approach to write css.
* Every css class must be prefixed with ```dc-```.

## Sass conventions:

* All variables and mixins must be prefixed with ```dc-``` and must use the ***snake-case*** (with dashes as separator).
